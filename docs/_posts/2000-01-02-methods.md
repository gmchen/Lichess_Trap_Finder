#### Searching for deadly chess traps using a depth-first search with stopping heuristics

Using the wonderful <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lichess.org/api">Lichess API</a>, I sought to identify the deadliest opening traps based on real-world user data.

My search strategy involved traversing the opening move tree using two main "deadliness" critera: the final position should have a high proportion of wins for a given attacking side, and the sequence of moves by the defending side should be likely to occur. We consider one attacking side at a time: for example, if playing the white pieces, we are looking for a position with a high proportion of wins for White, and for which the moves for Black are likely to be played based on user games. 

Specifically, the search strategy used the following criteria:

* The probability of the opponent playing the moves to get to the position is at least 1%
* Excluding the opponent's first move, the probability of the opponent playing the moves to get to the position is at least 10%
* The attacker has at least a 45% win rate in each position in the sequence of moves
* The most popular 10 moves are considered for the attacker
* The most popular 5 moves are considered for the defender's first move
* The most popular 2 moves are considered for the defender's second and subsequent moves
* The position has been played in at least 500 user games on Lichess

Tree traversal was implemented in Python using a depth-first search, leading to around 50,000 API queries and 200,000 positions considered.

From the positions obtained through this search, similar positions were grouped together, and a representative position with the highest win rate was visualized using the python-chess library and a custom matplotlib plotting function.
